This was a game which we should simulate the cellule life in a chart of some block
each block has a type and each type has a unique color
the guide of the block types and it color:
1 - energy block:
which is shown by green color , you can boost your cellule energy
2 - Mitose block:
which is shown by blue navy color , you can split your cellules just here
3 - blocked block:
which is shown by red color and you could not move to these type of cellules
4 - normal block:
which is shown by gray color and is just some block , do nothing realy

The game starts with a menu and you can choose each of its statement 
you will see these 5 statements:
1 - load
2 - single player
3 - multiplayer
4 - map editor
5 - exit

1 - load:

in the map editor , first you should decide about the height and width in your map,
then a map with desired dimension print out for you at the left side of console , 
you should choose a block by it's Cartesian coordinate address , then should choose 
the type of the block via the menu which will been shown you , do this until the type of all blocks have been defined .then you should choose the number of cellule you want to have , and put them in the blocks . like before ,you should choose the Cartesian coordinate .

at the end , you will be asked if you want to save this map or not
